    <p><br>The court was different, there were nets hanging from the roof of the hall. How are you going to get out of here,<br> 
           then in the coner of your eye you see a scoreboard and by your foot was a ball, so you picked up the ball and took<br> 
           a shot at the hoop it went in, and you shot repeatly Buzz!!! The buzzer went off you've won. The nets rolled back</br>
           up what are you going to do.<br>

      <br>Do you want to shoot more hoops<br> 
          or 
      <br>Do you want to exit the court<br>
