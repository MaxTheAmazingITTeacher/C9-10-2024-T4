    <p>You decide to go into the jungle abandoning the path. You wander through the forest<br>
      for hours until you finally emerge into a clearing. Relieved you sit down on a fallen log<br>
      to have a rest. After a few moments the sound of hissing reaches your ears, looking towards<br>
      the sound you see a horde of snakes on the opposite side of the clearing. You jump up,<br>
      only agravating them more. With a loud hiss one leaps towards you and the rest follow suit.</p>
