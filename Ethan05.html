    <p>With a loud scream you bolt back into the jungle in the direction you came from, <br>
      but the snakes follow you, weaving through the dense foliage much faster than you ever could. <br>
      As you charge blindly through the forest you fail to see the tree looming infront of you. <br>
      With a loud thwack you run into it face first and tumble to the ground. <br>
      In an instant the snakes are on you, you die horribly.</p>
