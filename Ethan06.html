    <p>Just before the snake's fangs sink into your flesh you punch it out of the air. <br>
      Each snake falls to your fists, and soon enough, they're all dead. <br>
      Wow, good thing you learned snake karate otherwise you wouldn't have stood a chance. <br>
      Your victory is short lived as night is quickly approaching, <br>
      soon it wouldn't just be snakes looking to eat you.</p>
