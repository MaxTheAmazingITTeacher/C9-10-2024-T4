    <p>You decide to return to the door to try a different one. As you wander through the <br>
      dark jungle you realise that you have no idea where you are, or from where you came. <br>
      These are the thoughts going through your mind as you push through a particularly <br>
      dense bush and stumble straight off a cliff. You scream in terror as you <br>
      hurtle down through the air and with a loud splat, its all over.</p>
