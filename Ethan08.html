    <p>Coming to the conclusion that wandering through the forest looking for shelter is <br>
      a better idea than stumbly around hoplessly through the forest for the door you came from, <br>
      you strike out into the jungle. As the sky grows darker with each minute you begin to <br>
      loose hope and soon you find yourself in pitch black darkness. Suddenly a lightning <br>
      strikes a massive tree beside you and cracks it in half. You don't scream or run <br>
      as the tree falls and crushes you. You die.</p>
