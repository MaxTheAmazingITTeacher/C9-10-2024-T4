    <p>You turn around and begin to walk back along the path, "Of course it wouldn't lead anywhere!" <br>
      you think to youself, not realising that you've veered off the trail. "Why would you follow <br>
      some random path in a jungle!" You are so distracted by your internal yapping that you <br>
      don't see you sheer clifface looming before you and you walk straight off it. You die.</p>
