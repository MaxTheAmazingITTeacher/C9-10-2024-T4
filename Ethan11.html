    <h2>Main Section</h2>
    <p>You continue along the path for quite a while more and eventually find a large cave, <br>
      it's getting dark and you don't really want to be out in the open at that time so <br>
      you head inside. It's cold and damp but it'll do so you sit down on a stone <br>
      outcropping. You hear a noise and curiously glance deeping into the cave <br>
      and you see the two glowing red eyes in the darkness staring <br>
      right at you.</p>
