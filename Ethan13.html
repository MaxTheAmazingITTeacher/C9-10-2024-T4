    <p>Thinking quickly you pull out your emergency popcorn out and throw it at the creature before you bolt, <br>
      leaving it behind. You run terrified through the forest along the path until you reach the door. You <br>
      throw it open and charge into the S-Block hall, then you blindly run into the exit, breaking the <br>
      locked door and probably getting an injury. Permanently traumatised you go down to B11.</p>
