    <p>You start walking through the dunes and continue for hours, as time goes by you begin to get thirsty. <br>
      As you reach the crest of a particularly massive dune you see an oasis in the distance with a large <br>
      lake in the center. You are very thirsty so you should probably go toward it to get a drink, but <br>
      you might loose the object you were heading toward.</p>
