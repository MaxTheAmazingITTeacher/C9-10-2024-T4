    <p>You start to walk towards the oasis, but soon thirst begins to take a toll on you and you are soon <br>
      stumbling through the desert. However there was no real chance of getting to it as in the dip <br>
      between two dunes you collapse from exhaustion and thirst. As you lie there in the sand with <br>
      the sun burning your skin you regret going out into the desert. You die.</p>
