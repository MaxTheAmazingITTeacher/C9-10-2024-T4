    <p>You turn back, having lost all hope of reaching the thing in the distance. Thirst soon <br>
      overtakes you and you realise that you never had a chance of finding the way back. You <br>
      collapse on the ground and the winds blow over you, suffocating you and burying your <br>
      body. You die.</p>
