    <p>You continue onward, if you went another way you would never find out what the thing is. Even as 
      thirst tires you, you contine on. Finally you reach it, a golf cart sitting ontop of a dune. 
      Starting the engine it seems to have fuel, surely it could quench some of your thirst.</p>
