    <p>After barely escaping Bowser, you knew you were doomed but remembered that Bowser had an extreme reaction when he consumes or even interacts with bananas, Bowser he's cooked.
       This is why Bowser is never at Donkey Kongs Kingdom, so you had to come up with a plan. The plan needed Simon this is because they needed any sort of banana, and this can be found in the canteen, but we wondered 'where'.
        So you and Simon get on searching for that banana before the big behemouth Bowser comes and stop you from reaching Princess Peach. Until Bowser comes crashing into the canteen but the same ti me you find a piece of banana bread.
      Would you like to smudge the banana bread on bowser or run away. </p>
