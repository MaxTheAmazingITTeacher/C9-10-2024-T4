		<h2>Going to the library</h2>
		<br>
		You grab the key from the broken guitar and bolt out of B11. 
		The fastest way to the library is through the basketball court, but what if Bowser knows you're going that way? You could try to outsmart him by going a different way.

		Do you want to go through the basketball court or go a different way? </p>
