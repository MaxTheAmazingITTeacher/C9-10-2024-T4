                As you press your foot hard on the accelerator and shot out of the garage, 
                past an astonished Bowser and into the street. You dimly wondered why you 
                had a car and when you had learned to drive! You don't wary about in and go 
                faster so Bowser doesn't catch you, you do some skids around the corners 
                and bends. The sky is blue, and the sun bright and is burning your back, 
                you think of stopping to get some sunscreen. You think of planning or go 
                and wander the streets.
