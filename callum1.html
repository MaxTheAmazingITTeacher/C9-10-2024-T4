				As you press your foot hard on the accelerator and shoot out of the garage, 
				past an astonished Bowser and into the street. 
				You dimly wonder why you had a car and when you had learned to drive!
				 You don’t wary about it and go faster so Bowser doesn’t catch you, 
				 you do some skids around the corners and bends.
				  The sky is blue, and the sun bright and is burning your back,
				   you think of getting some sunscreen.
				    You think of stopping or go and wander the streets..
