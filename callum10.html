				Looking around you see a person that works at Kmart, 
				going over there you ask her if she could open the shop,
				 she says no its not time to open.
				  You think of hitting her and taking the keys,
				   but people are everywhere.
				    Bye you say and you turn.
					 but turning around again swinging a punch you nock her out.
					  taking her keys you go back and try to unlock Kmart, before you could get to Kmart, someone shoots a gun.
                THE END
