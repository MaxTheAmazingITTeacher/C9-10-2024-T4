        <h3>
            You unlock Kmart and go to find some sunscreen, 
            first you look in the oil section.
             You couldnâ€™t find any there, 
             thinking you go to the beauty section. 
             Sunscreen is there, ten dollars per tube.
              Looking for a cheaper one, people start to scream. 
              Bowser had found you and was coming,
               hiding under a bookcase, someone tells Bowser where you were,
                getting out from under the bookcase, 
                Bowser yeets the person that told where you were at you.
                 Trying to grab her, you fall over,
                  and hit your head,
                   Bowser comes over and rips off your arms.

                   THE END
