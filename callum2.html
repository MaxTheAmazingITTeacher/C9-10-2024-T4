                              Bowser is looking at you with a bazooka pointing at your head.
                               You take out a banana and stuff it up the bazooka.
                                Bowser shouts and stamps his feet,
                                 blows the banana out and it hits your head. 
                                 You wake up Bowser is there still,
                                  with princess peach. How long were you knocked out for you think,
                                   looking down at Your seat there is a banana button, 
                                   with a couple dozen bananas in it.
