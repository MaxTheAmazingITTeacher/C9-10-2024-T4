				Driving down the road, you weave in and out of the traffic wildly,
				 you had obviously not learned to drive very well! 
				 Occasionally you came to a turn with a signpost, 
				 and you turned randomly down each road,
				  because you didn’t really know where you were.
				   You come to a warning sign, and it said, “FIRE AHEAD”,
				    you go anyway. Faster and faster, 
					you go through the fire your wheels are melting from the heat.
					 After a bit you hear a loud “BANG” you spin out of control,
					  and you land on a hot bit of road. Your skin starts to melt.
					   You burn alive. The end
