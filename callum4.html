				Hitting the button the bananas fly out of the banana shouter and smack princess peach,
				 one banana goes straight down her mouth, she starts to chock, going purple and then she faints.
				  Bowser pulls it out and chucks it away. Wiping his hand, he puts peach on the floor.
				   both of you are sweeting, you think to yourself what part of the body would hurt him most. 
				   You stand up and kick Bowser in the head, you think it was a good kick until he smacks you up the head with the bazooka.
				    you fly ten meters back and smash the window of a car, driving past you. you hit the ground on the other side of the car, you die.
					 The end
