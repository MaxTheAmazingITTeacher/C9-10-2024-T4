                You start to get out of the car, Bowser doesn't move.
                 You turn super-fast and run even faster, 
                 through the road and past cars. Bowser starts to follow;
                  he smashes the car in his way. 
                  You hide in the biggest car in you can find in a very short time.
                   You start to drive slowly away from Bowser, down past cars and trucks. 
                   Hitting a couple of them on your way down. 
                   Coming to a pair of lights you look and see a sign that said “library”.
