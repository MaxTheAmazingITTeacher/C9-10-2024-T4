    <h2>You hide from Bowser</h2>
    <p>You sprint out of the school and you can hear Bowser coming but you dont know how far away he is so you and princess peach find a bush and hide in it till he passes.
     Bowser looked very angry and he passes at a heart pumping seed. Once he passed you and princess peach get out of the bush and start running back the way you came.</p>
