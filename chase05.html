    <h2></h2>
    <p>You decide to call luigi and that is a good choice because Bowser reappers from the bathroom and he is more
      powerful. Luigi is also very strong and because you called him it is a 1v2 so you have the upper hand. Bowser puts
      a good fight up but the two of you are to strong and take down Bowser. You, luigi and princess peach live happily
      ever after. </p>
