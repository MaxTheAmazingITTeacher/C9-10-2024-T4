    <h2>Continuing down the main road, your mind drifts to thoughts about the crazy scenario you've found yourself in.
       "What are all these characters from my favourite video games doing in the real world? Why is Bowser concerned with me?
        I'm just a kid living in [insert suburb here], not a threat to a fiery, massive lizard! What does he think I want regarding Peach?
        <p>After a few moments like this, you gather your thoughts and ponder what to do next. "Well, for a start, it seems like a good idea 
          to try and find Peach. But where could she be? Bowser did say that she has everything she needs where she is, but that would mean... 
          "Of course! The library! There's food and water, and enough books to last a lifetime there! That's where she must be!"</p></h2>
