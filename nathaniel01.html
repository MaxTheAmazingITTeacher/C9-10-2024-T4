        <h2>  Continuing down the main road, your mind drifts to thoughts about the crazy scenario you've found yourself in.
          "What are all these characters from my favourite video games doing in the real world? Why is Bowser concerned with me?
          I'm just a kid living in [insert suburb here], not a threat to a fiery, massive lizard! What does he think I want regarding Peach?
        <p>After a few moments like this, you gather your thoughts and ponder what to do next. "Well, for a start, it seems like a good idea 
          to try and find Peach. But where could she be? Bowser did say that she has everything she needs where she is, but that would mean... 
          "Of course! The library! There's food and water, and enough books to last a lifetime there! That's where she must be!".</p>
        <p>Snapping quickly back to reality with new motivation, you notice you lost track of the speedometer on the car's dashboard. 
          The red needle on the display is pointing to two ticks right of a white "80". "Whoops!" you think to yourself, "I lost focus on 
          reality there for a second! This is a 60 zone, but it's empty enough that I might be able to keep going at this speed.". If you go 
          too fast, you might end up crashing the car, but if you keep to the speed limit, who knows if you're going to make it there in time! 
          Either way, now is the time to make the decision.</p></h2>
