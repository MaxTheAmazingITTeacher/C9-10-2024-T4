    <h1>Speed up</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>You decide to hit the gas, shutting out all the statistics and advice to do with speeding from making you uneasy.
        The car's speed climbs, and as you watch the speedometer you see the indicated number climb higher and higher.
        90, 100, 110, and the car hits maximum speed at 120 kilometres per hour. "I'll be there in no time!" you thought, 
        and moments later a sharp corner causes you to drift off the road, crashing and tumbling into a patch of bushland. 
        This is the last thing you remember from before you were knocked unconscious by a falling coconut.
