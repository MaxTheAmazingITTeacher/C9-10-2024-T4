    <h1>Hospital</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>You wake up in hospital surrounded by friends and family, some looking afraid or concerned and others disappointed by how you 
        ended up here. You check the calendar beside the bed. "Crikey, it's been a week!" you exclaim. Without enough time left to 
        recover and then save the princess, you slump in bed defeated. You hope Peach is okay, but any say you had in the matter is 
        long gone. The next thirty minutes or so you spend trying to justify what you were doing to your family, and the rest of the 
        day you spend in bed at home. You heal enough from your injuries to return to school in a week, but upon checking the library 
        you find that Peach is nowhere to be seen.</h2>
