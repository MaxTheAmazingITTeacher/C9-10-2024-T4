    <h2>On your way towards the school, you remember that there's a faster route that begins by taking a turn at the next junction. 
        It's a much more direct route to the school than the ordinary one you remember the most, and all the times you've been that 
        way the roads have been empty, evidencing how you are obviously one of the few elite members of society who know about such 
        a prestidgious shortcut. However, the normal route is more familiar to you, and might be a better choice.
