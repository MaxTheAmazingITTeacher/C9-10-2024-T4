  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>The shortcut almost works, but you accidentally drive into the centre of a roundabout and get flung out of your car, 
        landing unconscious in your friend Callum's swimming pool. Unluckily, Bayside Christian College's Year 10 students 
        haven't finished learning lifesaving, and in trying to save you with what little he remembered from the lessons he 
        drowns in your place. His heroic sacrifice will not be in vain, as you are out of the water, recovering on the grass. 
        However, you now have a lot of explaining to do, as you were not invited over and there is hardly any realistic 
        explanation as to how you got there or how Callum drowned in the pool. This is a good time to call it a game over 
        instead of going through the consequences of what just happened.
