    <h2>The shortcut is not, in fact, something only you know about, and you end up stuck in rush-hour traffic. 
        You see Bowser walking towards you, and in your haste to get away from him you forget that the other lane 
        isn't backed up with cars. You get hit by a lorry. This is why you look both ways before you cross the 
        road. You die.
