    <h2>A quarter of the way along the usual commute to school (that ordinarily your parents drive for you), the car breaks down.
        It would've ground to a halt under reasonable conditions, but at the speed you're going it ends up drifting and tumbling, 
        barely keeping you sheltered from the repeated collisions with the road. Once it comes to a stop, the doors are ruined 
        to the point that you cannot free yourself from the wreckage. Luckily, the airflow is good and nothing is set on fire, so 
        you wait for the paramedics to arrive. After being freed from the wreckage, you are quickly rushed to the hospital to be 
        checked for injuries. You spend a good few hours at the hospital, only to be returned home and get yelled at by your 
        parents. You try and explain what happened, but they do not believe you, and you do not resume the adventure. Game over.
