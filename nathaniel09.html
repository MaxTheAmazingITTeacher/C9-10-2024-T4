    <h1>Ordinary route</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>A quarter of the way along the usual commute to school (that ordinarily your parents drive for you), the car breaks down. 
      It quickly grinds to a halt, and you are barely able to pull over to the side of the road before the car loses functionality. 
      "Shouldn't've cancelled the appointment with the mechanic" you mutter to yourself, but you cannot even remember when you got 
      the car, let alone the time you postponed its routine maintenance. You now have a predicament in front of you: seeing as the 
      car is broken, the only option to get to school if you don't fix somehow is to walk, but do you <i>really</i> want to walk? 
      You've got a car now for whatever reason, walking is for chumps! But now the question remains: how do you fix the car? It 
      could be something simple enough to fix by hand, you never know without taking a look inside. But then you remember Luigi. 
      Not only is he a plumber, he's also a certified auto mechanic for when his car breaks down on the racetrack. You have a 
      phone on you (yet another great mystery!), so you could call him. Or you could try and fix the car yourself, or... ugh... 
      walk to school and not bother with any of this mess. Which do you choose?
