    <h2>You try and diagnose what's wrong with the engine, but you have no luck in finding the problem. You look at all the bits and pieces, 
      the pipes and the cooling loops, the gearbox and the spark plugs, but you cannot quite find what is wrong. "Looks like the problem is 
      internal" you think to yourself, and while you could in theory open the engine to find whatever problem is being had there yourself, 
      the sentiment of calling Luigi becomes more attractive the more you think about it. You still could go walking to school, but it 
      really doesn't feel worth it.
