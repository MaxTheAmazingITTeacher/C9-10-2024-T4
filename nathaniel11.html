    <h2>You open up the engine successfully and can immediately see the problem that stopped the engine. The input in the engine where fuel from the tanks 
      normally flows in is disconnected from the piston chambers, and while it's very strange that this happened, you know you can fix it. Wonderful! You 
      didn't have to wait for Luigi or pool together enough money to pay him (auto mechanics don't usually work for free!), and the car's fixed again! You 
      turn the car back on, and it starts moving. Excellent! Or rather, it was excellent, before your cobbled-together connection in the engine allowed 
      flames from the explosions in the piston chambers to spread through the pipes into the fuel tank. Oops. The last thing you remember before you fell 
      unconscious is a blinding flash and a deafening bang.
